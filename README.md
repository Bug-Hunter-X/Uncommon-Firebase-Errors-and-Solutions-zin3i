# Uncommon Firebase Errors and Solutions

This repository demonstrates some uncommon errors encountered when using the Firebase SDK, along with their solutions.  The errors covered include handling data unavailability, asynchronous operations, limitations of Realtime Database indexing, and circular dependencies in data structures.  Each error is illustrated with a JavaScript code example, showing both the problematic code and the corrected version.  This repository aims to serve as a helpful resource for developers working with Firebase to identify and resolve these less frequent, yet potentially challenging, issues.
