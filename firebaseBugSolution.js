To address data unavailability, always include robust error handling.  Use `.catch()` blocks to handle potential errors during data access.
For asynchronous operations, always use async/await or promises correctly.  Avoid using callbacks directly where possible.  Structure your code to properly handle promise resolution and rejection.
To optimize Realtime Database queries, ensure proper indexing is implemented for efficient data retrieval. Consult Firebase documentation on indexing best practices.
Finally, to prevent circular dependencies, carefully design your data model.  Avoid creating situations where a node's parent depends on a child, or vice-versa.  Use a normalized data structure where necessary.
